UNIT 8 DISCUSSION: BREADTH-FIRST SEARCH (BFS)
===========================================================

STUDENT INSTRUCTIONS:

This assignment is designed to help you understand how graphs
are traversed using Breadth-First Search (BFS) and how this
applies to real-world systems (e.g., networks, routes,
social connections).

    TODO (Student):
    Implement Breadth-First Search (BFS).

    Requirements:
    - Use a queue to manage traversal order.
    - Track visited nodes to prevent revisiting nodes.
    - Visit nodes level by level.
    - Return the order in which nodes were visited.

    Add comments explaining:
    - Why a queue is used.
    - Why neighbors are added to the queue.
    - How BFS differs from depth-first traversal.

    # ===============================
    #
    # Requirements:
    # 1. Create a graph using an adjacency list.
    # 2. Include at least 6 nodes.
    # 3. Include multiple connections between nodes.
    # 4. Clearly display the graph structure.
    # 5. Use comments to explain what the nodes and edges represent.

    # TODO (Student): BFS TRAVERSAL
    # ===============================
    #
    # Requirements:
    # 1. Select a starting node.
    # 2. Perform BFS traversal.
    # 3. Display the traversal order.
    # 4. Use comments to explain how BFS visits nodes level by level.
    # 5. Add at least one additional node or edge
    #    and demonstrate the updated traversal.

    # TODO (Student): EDGE CASES
    # ===============================
    #
    # Demonstrate at least two edge cases.

    # Example ideas:
    # - Start from a different node
    # - Use a disconnected graph
    # - Handle a missing start node safely
    # - Graph containing only one node
    # - Empty graph
    #
    # Explain what happens in each case.
